      <h3>💡 What I Admire About Ratan Tata</h3>
      <p>
        What I admire most about Ratan Tata is not just his success as a businessman, but his humility and commitment to giving back to society.  
        He has always believed that business should serve the community, and under his leadership, the Tata Group became a symbol of trust and integrity.
